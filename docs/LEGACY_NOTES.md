ðŸ•° Legacy Notes

Original Development: Feb â€“ Mar 2011 at VIT University, India, as a second-year academic project in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

Original Environment: Python 2.7 / 3.2 era; legacy library versions:

numpy==1.6.*

scipy==0.10.*

matplotlib==1.1.*

sympy==0.7.*

Original Focus:

Signal processing using Fourier and Laplace transforms

Noise reduction, filtering, and frequency-domain analysis

Applications in biomedical signal processing (ECG/EEG)

Modernization Notes (2025 v0.1.0):

Updated to Python 3.11 with current library versions (numpy==2.0.*, scipy==1.13.*, matplotlib==3.9.*, sympy==1.13.*)

Centralized reusable code in src/signal_analysis.py

Added CLI (python -m src.signal_analysis --demo)

Added CI/CD with pytest smoke tests and GitHub Actions

Automated metrics CSV (SNR/PSNR) and plots generation

Dual Environment Strategy:

Modern (2025): Fully supported, actively maintained

Legacy (2011): Optional environment-2011.txt pinned for transparency; not recommended for active use

Purpose of Public Repo:

Showcase original problem-solving and algorithmic approach

Demonstrate modernization and reproducible pipelines

Highlight skills in Python, DSP, and CI/CD for potential recruiters
