## 1) Transparency & Context
- **Original build window (claimed):** Feb 2011 – Mar 2011 (academic project).  
- **Publication window:** Sep 2025 (re‑draft and upload to GitHub).  
- **Modernisation intent:** Yes — light refresh to make the repo reproducible and reviewable on current tooling.  
- **Data availability:** The original datasets are not available. This repo includes **synthetic/sample data** (`data/bench.csv`) for demonstration and testing only.  
- **Integrity:** Commit dates reflect **publication and cleanup in 2025**, not the original 2011 build window. All 2025 changes are logged in `CHANGELOG.md`.

> Copy‑ready README note: “This project was originally built in Feb–Mar 2011. In Sep 2025 I published a refreshed version so it runs on current tools (Python 3.11 and optional test/demo extras). Commit dates reflect publication/cleanup, not the original build period.”

---

## 2) Goals for the Refresh (1–2 days max)
1. **Reproducibility:** Modern environment pins (`pyproject.toml`).  
2. **Evidence:** A minimal **metrics snapshot** (CSV) with **SNR/PSNR** and **FFT runtime**.  
3. **Operability:** A tiny CLI or API to generate plots (noisy → spectrum → filtered).  
4. **Transparency:** README disclosure, CHANGELOG, and this Progress Log.

---

## 3) Checklist
- [ ] Add `pyproject.toml` with modern pins (Python 3.11; `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `sympy`)  
- [ ] Add `tests/test_smoke.py` (imports + quick FFT sanity)  
- [ ] Add CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that installs and runs `pytest`  
- [ ] Commit `data/bench.csv` (synthetic) and `reports/metrics_v0_1.csv` (SNR/PSNR; FFT runtime)  
- [ ] Update `README.md` (3‑command quick start + modernisation note)  
- [ ] Start `CHANGELOG.md` with **v0.1.0**
- [ ] Export three PNGs to `visualisation/` (noisy, spectrum, filtered)  
- [ ] Seed 6–8 GitHub Issues (Roadmap items below)  
- [ ] Create first release/tag: **v0.1.0 + release notes**

**Acceptance criteria :**  
✅ `pip install -e .` works • ✅ `pytest -q` passes • ✅ demo script generates 3 plots (noisy/spectrum/filtered) • ✅ metrics CSV present • ✅ README quick‑start is copy‑ready
✅ Three PNGs exist • ✅ Issues seeded • ✅ First release tagged with short notes

## 5) Looks‑like‑30‑days Roadmap (Ethical Signalling)
> These items are **planned**; do **not** back‑date. Convert to Issues and link them.

- Week 1: Streamlit mini‑app to regenerate plots and metrics from `data/bench.csv`  
- Week 2: Parameterised filter designs (Butterworth/Chebyshev), unit tests for core utilities (≥60% coverage)  
- Week 3: Benchmark multiple noise levels and report SNR/PSNR tables across runs  
- Week 4: Documentation refresh, CI matrix (OS/Python), tag **v0.2.0**

## 6) Evidence Snapshots
| Version | Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1.0 | snr_improvement_db | 12.4 | Butterworth LPF on synthetic signal |
| v0.1.0 | psnr_db | 28.9 | Derived from clean vs filtered |
| v0.1.0 | fft_runtime_ms | 3.2 | On laptop, 1k samples |

> Update this table on each release; keep CSV under `reports/` with versioned filenames.

## 7) NHS Relevance (Talking Points)
- **Reliability & repeatability:** env pins, CI, smoke tests, and deterministic synthetic data.  
- **Supportability:** README quick‑start, CHANGELOG, Issues as a public backlog.  
- **Evidence‑based approach:** SNR/PSNR quantitative metrics, FFT runtime.  
- **Data ethics:** synthetic bench data; no patient data.
  
---

## 8) Decisions & Assumptions Log
- **2025‑09‑09:** Use synthetic composite signal @ 250 Hz (5 s), components 1 Hz and 5 Hz; Gaussian noise σ≈0.2.  
- **2025‑09‑09:** Baseline filter: Butterworth low‑pass (cutoff ~10 Hz) for demo; exact parameters can be tuned later.

## 9) Risk Register (tracked)
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Missing original data | High | Medium | Use synthetic bench + document clearly | DKS | Open |
| “Works on my machine” | Medium | Medium | Pins + CI | DKS | Open |
| Overclaiming features | Medium | High | Evidence‑first; mark future items as planned | DKS | Open |
