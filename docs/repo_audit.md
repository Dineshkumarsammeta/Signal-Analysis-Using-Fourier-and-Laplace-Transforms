# Repository Audit Report – Signal Analysis Project

**Project:** Signal Analysis Using Fourier and Laplace Transforms  
**Modernization Year:** 2025  
**Author:** Sammeta Dinesh Kumar

## 1. Overview
This report evaluates repository health, code quality, maintainability, and readiness for modern Python environments.

---

## 2. Code Quality
- ✅ Python 3.8+ compatible
- ⚡ PEP8-compliant with minor improvements possible
- ⚠ No automated tests yet (planned with `pytest`)

---

## 3. Repository Structure
- Clear separation of `data/`, `src/`, and `results/plots/`
- Recommended: add `tests/` folder and archive legacy scripts

---

## 4. Dependencies
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, SymPy, Pandas
- Versions pinned in `requirements.txt` for reproducibility

---

## 5. CI/CD & Automation
- ⚠ No CI/CD yet
- Planned: GitHub Actions to run scripts, generate plots, and export CSV/PNG artifacts

---

## 6. Documentation
- README provides overview, setup, results, and contact info
- Recommended: add inline docstrings and a dedicated `docs/` folder for methodology

---

## 7. Security & Licensing
- ⚠ Add a LICENSE file (MIT or Apache 2.0)
- No sensitive data exposed

---

## 8. Recommendations / Next Steps
1. Add automated tests (`pytest`) for FFT, filtering, and Laplace transforms
2. Implement CI/CD workflow for reproducibility
3. Include LICENSE file
4. Add inline function docstrings
5. Optionally provide Jupyter notebook for interactive demos
6. Archive original 2011 scripts in `legacy/` folder
