# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project was originally developed and tested in **2011**.  
Due to advancements in Python libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`), some parts may not run as intended in modern environments without modifications.

| Version / Year | Supported          |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 2011 code      | :white_check_mark: Conceptually supported (may require modern adjustments) |
| < 2011         | :x: Not supported  |

> ⚠️ Note: The repository focuses on **concepts, algorithms, and implementation methods**, rather than up-to-date library compatibility.
